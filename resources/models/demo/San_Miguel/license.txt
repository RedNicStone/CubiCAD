________________________________________________________

This scene was modeled by Guillermo M. Leal Llaguno of Evolucien Visual, 
based on a hacienda that he visited in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico. 

We began with Guillermo's original 3DS Max file and flattened the instancing
from the original for convenience in research use. We then exported it as an
OBJ file, corrected the geometry and materials, converted materials to PNG
and integrated the alpha mattes, and constructed a low-polygon 
version.

For example, on the cover of the PBRT2 book, you can see that there
are chairs in the fountain and no legs on the tables! We fixed these
and many more problems.
